## Trying to find a window.

Yes, I can help with that! To close a newly opened window in Playwright, you'll need to keep track of the window (or page) object associated with it. Here’s a step-by-step guide to handle this scenario:

1. **Capture the newly opened page**: When a new window is opened, Playwright creates a new `Page` object. You can listen for the `context.on('page')` event to capture the new window.

2. **Close the new page**: Once you have a reference to the new `Page` object, you can simply call its `close()` method.

Here’s an example:

```js
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('close new window', async ({ browser }) => {
  // Create a browser context
  const context = await browser.newContext();

  // Create a page
  const page = await context.newPage();

  // Listen for a new page (new window/tab) to open
  const [newPage] = await Promise.all([
    context.waitForEvent('page'),
    page.click('button#open-new-window')  // Simulate a button click that opens a new window
  ]);

  // Wait for the new page to load its content (if needed)
  await newPage.waitForLoadState();

  // Now you can interact with the new page or verify its content
  expect(newPage.url()).toContain('expected-content');

  // Close the new window
  await newPage.close();

  // Continue with your test or assertions
});
```

### Explanation:
- `context.waitForEvent('page')`: This waits for a new page (or window) to be opened.
- `page.click()`: Simulates the action (like clicking a button) that triggers the new window to open.
- `newPage.close()`: This closes the newly opened window.

By following this approach, you can open and close windows in Playwright smoothly! Let me know if you need further clarification or modifications to the code!

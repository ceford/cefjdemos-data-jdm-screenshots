Yes, I can help! To take a screenshot of a specific `div` containing an `h3` with a specific text in Playwright, you can use the `page.locator()` method to find the div based on the h3 text. Then, you can take a screenshot of that specific element.

Here's how to do it in JavaScript:

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
  // Start browser and open a new page
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Navigate to the page where the div is located
  await page.goto('https://example.com'); // Replace with your URL

  // Locate the div containing an h3 with the specific text
  const divLocator = page.locator('div:has(h3:has-text("Your Specific Text"))');

  // Wait for the div to be visible (optional, depending on your needs)
  await divLocator.waitFor();

  // Take a screenshot of the located div
  await divLocator.screenshot({ path: 'div_screenshot.png' });

  // Close the browser
  await browser.close();
})();
```

### Explanation
1. **`page.locator()`** - We use `page.locator()` to locate the div element. The `:has()` pseudo-class selects elements that have a child matching the provided selector. In this case, we look for a `div` that has an `h3` child with the specified text.
2. **`await divLocator.waitFor()`** - This waits for the element to be present on the page.
3. **`await divLocator.screenshot()`** - This takes a screenshot of just the located `div`.

Replace `"Your Specific Text"` with the actual text you're looking for in the `h3` element. The screenshot will be saved as `div_screenshot.png`.

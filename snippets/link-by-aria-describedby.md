To select a link with a specific `aria-describedby` attribute value in Playwright, you can use the `aria` selector with the `aria-describedby` attribute. Playwright's `aria` selector syntax allows you to target elements with specific ARIA attributes, which is very helpful when dealing with accessibility-focused attributes like `aria-describedby`.

Here’s how you can do it:

```javascript
// Using Playwright's aria selector with aria-describedby attribute
await page.locator('aria/[aria-describedby="your-value"]').click();
```

### Explanation

- `aria/` prefix tells Playwright to use an accessibility selector.
- `[aria-describedby="your-value"]` specifies the element with the `aria-describedby` attribute set to the specific value (`your-value`).

### Example

If you want to click a link with `aria-describedby="unique-description"`, the code would look like this:

```javascript
await page.locator('aria/[aria-describedby="unique-description"]').click();
```

### Alternative CSS Selector Approach

If you prefer, you can also use a CSS selector:

```javascript
await page.locator('a[aria-describedby="your-value"]').click();
```

This approach is especially useful if you want to ensure you’re only targeting `<a>` tags specifically.

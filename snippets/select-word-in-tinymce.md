## Select a Word in a Page inside TinyMCE

Since you're using TinyMCE, selecting a visible word or text involves dealing with the internal structure of the editor, which is more complex than plain HTML. TinyMCE abstracts the content within an iframe, so direct interaction with document elements requires different handling.

If you're trying to select or highlight text within the TinyMCE editor using Playwright, you can:

1. Access the content inside the TinyMCE iframe.
2. Work with the editor's API for text selection and manipulation.

Here's an alternative approach to select text in the TinyMCE editor using Playwright:

### Steps:

1. **Switch to the TinyMCE iframe**.
2. **Access the content inside the editor**.
3. **Select the word using JavaScript in the context of the editor**.

Here's how you could automate this with Playwright:

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
  const context = await browser.newContext();
  const page = await context.newPage();

  // Navigate to the page with TinyMCE editor
  await page.goto('https://example.com'); // Replace with the actual URL

  // Wait for the TinyMCE editor to load
  await page.waitForSelector('iframe'); // Adjust the selector if needed for TinyMCE's iframe

  // Switch to the TinyMCE iframe
  const frame = await page.frame({ url: /tinymce/i }); // Assuming the TinyMCE iframe has 'tinymce' in the URL

  // Execute selection of the text in TinyMCE's editor
  await frame.evaluate(() => {
    const editor = tinymce.activeEditor;
    const textToSelect = "yourWord"; // Replace with the word you want to select

    const content = editor.getContent({ format: 'text' });
    const wordIndex = content.indexOf(textToSelect);

    if (wordIndex !== -1) {
      const selection = editor.selection;
      selection.setCursorLocation(editor.getBody().firstChild, wordIndex);
      selection.extend(editor.getBody().firstChild, wordIndex + textToSelect.length);
    }
  });

  // Keep browser open to see the result
  await page.waitForTimeout(5000);

  await browser.close();
})();
```

### Key Points:
1. **Switch to the TinyMCE iframe**: TinyMCE operates inside an iframe, so we need to access it with `page.frame`.
2. **Use TinyMCE API**: The TinyMCE editor has its own API to manage text selection, which is more reliable than raw DOM manipulation for content inside the editor.
   - `tinymce.activeEditor`: Refers to the currently active TinyMCE instance.
   - `editor.selection`: Allows you to programmatically select content.
3. **Select the word**: The code finds the word in the editor's content and uses `setCursorLocation` and `extend` to create the selection.

### Manual Option:
If automating this is not working for you at the moment, continuing with manual selection might be the simplest approach while you work on refining the automation steps. This method can still serve as a foundation for future automation.

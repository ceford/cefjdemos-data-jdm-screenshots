Message to Harald,

Hello Harald,

Since your message I looked up Cypress vs Playright and decided to give the latter a try. After much frustration I am finally getting somewhere and now completely agree that scripting the screenshots is the best way forward.

Do you have a view on a screen resolution to use for capture? In the past I have limited screenshots to 1000 pixels wide and more recently 1200. Now I am inclined to go to 1400 or 1440 as 1400 is one of the Bootstrap breakpoints.

I estimate that there are a little over 700 Help screenshots. With 1440 width and an average size of about 100Kb that would be about 70Mb in total for English alone.

I think it would be best to use a standard data set for capture. Perhaps the Multilingual sample data. And mostly with Workflow turned off. Do you have a view on that?

Some interesting problems have turned up. The Firefox browser works quite well but a screenshot of a modal dialog (batch for example) does not render the background so it is illegible. The Chromium browser will not render a screenshot with a modal dialog at all. Webkit (Safari) does everything well but ignores the viewport setting and uses my screen resolution.

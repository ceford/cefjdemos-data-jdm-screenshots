<p>A mammal (from Latin mamma 'breast') is a vertebrate animal of the class Mammalia.</p>
<hr id="system-readmore">
<p>Mammals are characterized by the presence of milk-producing mammary glands for feeding their young, a broad neocortex region of the brain, fur or hair, and three middle ear bones. These characteristics distinguish them from reptiles and birds, from which their ancestors diverged in the Carboniferous Period over 300 million years ago. Around 6,400 extant species of mammals have been described and divided into 29 orders.</p>
<p>The largest orders of mammals, by number of species, are the rodents, bats, and Eulipotyphla (including hedgehogs, moles and shrews). The next three are the primates (including humans, monkeys and lemurs), the even-toed ungulates (including pigs, camels, and whales), and the Carnivora (including cats, dogs, and seals).</p>

Created article Gibbons in category Apes

> Gibbons are small, tree-dwelling apes found primarily in the dense forests of Southeast Asia. Known for their remarkable agility, gibbons move through the forest canopy by swinging between branches in a form of locomotion called brachiation. Their long arms and lightweight bodies allow them to cover great distances with each swing, making them among the most efficient and acrobatic of all primates.

>These social animals are also known for their distinctive songs, which are used to communicate with other gibbons and establish territory. Gibbons form strong monogamous pairs, and they play a vital role in maintaining the health of their forest ecosystems by dispersing seeds as they feed on a variety of fruits.
